pollipal and genomics starting to live here

These were a ton of scripts I through together to document my masters dissertation which seeked to use the angiosperms 353 probes for plant metagenomics.
Some of the scripts are more general usage for pollinator ecolgy. I plan on splitting out all of these and pushing out as part of two packages.
A good amount of this info came from folks at CBG who employ some of these technicques more often than folks at smaller universities and institutes do. I hope their insight is helpful to your endeavors if you are in these camps. 

Alot of the documentation is pretty shoddy (heya!), but in general just down these scripts, knit em to pdf, send to the printer, cut down and glue into your notebook and keep on.
